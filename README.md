As cyberattacks continue to disrupt modern enterprises, organizations urgently need vigilant security operations center (SOC) analysts who can detect and stop threats fast. With modern SIEMs and ingestion strategies, much of the necessary data is already within easy reach. This book provides you with the daily tactics, techniques, and procedures of a SOC analyst and shows how to exceed expectations in a modern SOC.
The book builds a solid foundation in security operations, preparing you for the SOC analyst role and other positions within the SOC. With this base in place, you’ll advance into key SOC roles and blue team principles, such as detection and engineering. You’ll be able to clearly articulate your future as a SOC analyst in an interview as well as talk about your career path to impress prospective employers. You’ll get to grips with advanced threat actors, including advanced persistent threats (APTs) that wield considerable resources in campaigning against an organization. The chapters cover important concepts, such as governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), blue and red team tools, network security, web app security, and job search skills.
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to demonstrate competency and acquire a SOC analyst position with an additional career outlook moving forward.</details>

Kyler Kent is a Senior Cybersecurity Analyst at CrowdStrike's Falcon Complete MDR, where he helps organizations detect, investigate, and contain real-world threats—especially across cloud and hybrid environments. His work blends threat hunting, incident response, and security automation to turn noisy telemetry into clear actions that reduce risk fast.

He holds a Master's in Cybersecurity Risk Management from Georgetown University and maintains advanced industry certifications including CISSP, AWS Solutions Architect – Professional, AWS Security – Specialty, and multiple CrowdStrike certifications. 
Kyler writes to bridge the gap between theory and the work analysts actually do on shift—prioritizing practical decision-making, repeatable workflows, and the skills that accelerate a SOC career. When he's not solving MDR problems, he contributes to professional communities and advisory efforts across cybersecurity and IT.
